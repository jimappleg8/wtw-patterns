<h1>Buckminster Fuller -- What I Am Trying To Do</h1>

<blockquote>"Acutely aware of our beings' limitations and acknowledging the infinite mystery of the priori Universe... into which we are born but nevertheless searching for a conscious means of hopefully competent participation by humanity in its own evolutionary trending while employing only the unique advantages inhering exclusively to those individuals how to take and maintain the economic initiative in the face of the formidable physical capital and credit advantage of the massive corporation and political states and deliberately avoiding political ties and tactics, while endeavoring by experiments and explorations to excite individuals' awareness and realization of humanity's, being intent thereby to accomplish prototyped capabilities of, doing more with less whereby in turn the wealth augmenting prospects of such design science regenerations will both permit and induce all humanity to realize full lasting economic and physical success plus enjoyment of the earth without one individual interfering with or being advantage at the expense of another."</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the statements that prompted me to begin identifying patterns for a World The Works. As such, it's important that it's points be covered in the patterns.</p>

<ul>
<li>our beings' limitations</li>
<li>infinite mystery of the priori Universe -- Fundamental Mystery ()</li>
<li>conscious means of participation by humanity in its own evolutionary trending</li>
<li>competent participation by humanity in its own evolutionary trending</li>
<li>wealth augmenting prospects of such design science regenerations -- Wealth as Capacity ()</li>
</ul>
