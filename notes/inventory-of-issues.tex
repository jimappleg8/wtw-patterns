Inventory of Issues

Issues are problems as they are commonly viewed by the public, politicians, and the press. They tend to be broad statements about what is not working. I need to look at the patterns in the context of these to ensure that they can be addressed to some degree.

The patterns themselves try not to approach the world from a problem-centered perspective, but I think we need to have  list of problems that the patterns can be viewed next to.
