Implementation
	% I think it is probably not enough just to come up with better designs; they need to be implemented.

"At the end of the day what we find is that problems lie at the implementation level. Governance and corruption really hamper development and growth. Another major problem is exclusion of people and communities."
	% Note the unequal access

I read a complaint that countries are "developing infrastructure and focusing on fashionable sectors â€” industry and services". They are "concentrating on finding high tech solutions to low tech problems" when they need to just get back to the basics.

"To understand the progress on the MDGs, we have to really, really narrow down and go local."
	% This may be a sub-pattern of the World Success Indicators pattern.
