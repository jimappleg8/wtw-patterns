Inventory of Organizations
People Trying to Make a Difference

This is kind of a Who's Who of the kinds of organizations trying to improve things. Ideally this list would contain people and organizations both in line with the patterns and not in line with the patterns. I think I need both to get a balanced view of why the patterns are one way and not necessarily in line with everyone. Ideally, I would be able to explain why a particular idea does not move us toward a World That Works. I also think researching these groups and individuals would offer a rich wource of info about what is working.

I think to some degree, this inventor and the inventory of issues support each other. Issues, once identifed, are often linked to some group trying to do something about them. Groups may be working on different levels or aspects of a problem, but they alsmost always see themselves as trying to resolve an issue.
