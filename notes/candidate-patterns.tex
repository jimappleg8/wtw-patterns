Candidate Patterns

==============

=================================================
 PART 1
=================================================

	xx  Freedom to Flourish   % new pattern
		% I'm not sure where this should go, but the idea is based on an interview I heard on The World (28 Aug 2008) about a World Health Organization study about the social determinants of health: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2008/pr29/en/index.html
		% Sir Michael Marmot, Commission Chair said: “Central to the Commission’s recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered, to have freedom to lead flourishing lives. Nowhere is lack of empowerment more obvious than in the plight of women in many parts of the world. Health suffers as a result. Following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people.”
		% I think this is at least related the the Gates Foundation's stated mission "Because all people deserve the right to live full and productive lives."
		
	xx  Protected Mothers and Children   % new pattern
		% like "Freedom to Flourish" I'm not sure where this should go.
		% This pattern addresses the idea that we should help pregnant women and their children to reduce the need for abortion. I'm not really sure how to broach this subject, but this angle makes some sense to me. The goal is not to eliminate abortion by edict, but we aught to be creating an environment where abortion is not necesarily the preferred solution to a problem.
		% I think it might make sense to go a bit bigger on this and refer to the process of creating the next generation -- of procreation. We have left this process up to individuals, as we should, but perhaps there are some things we can say about it regarding parenting, abortion, population control, and a number of issues. What are the things we can do to help ensure that the next generation is less damaged than us?

?   xx  Civilization   % new pattern
		% I'm not sure if this is a pattern or a group. What are the foundations of civilization and how do we ensure that they are represented? I don't think they are based in government or infrastructure, but I think they begin with community and involve ethics and a number of the other human-specific qualities that we look at in this first section. They may include things like art and music.
		
?	xx  Equal Access   % new pattern
		% The concept at the heart of many of the patterns in this first section is the need for even distribution of services, opportunities, and resources. When electricity isn't available to some people, or education, or roads, or food, or anything that we take for granted in the developed world, that causes a lot of issues.

?	xx  Room for Nonconformists   % new pattern
		% We need for people who don't agree with these patterns to have a place in the society. Part of the role of civilization is to set limits on what behavior is acceptable. I certainly don't think anarchy is a good approach to creating a world that works. But we need to be very careful about what limit we choose.
		% In a sense, we are talking about a contract or a covenant. In exchange for a good life, we agree to play by the rules. Perhaps the way to do better is to make the rules explicit. Fuller did some of this with his discussion of how we have to prove our value by earning the right to exist, and how it is implicit that we will have to take from others so we can survive.

?	xx  Employment   % new pattern
		% I need to address the issue of jobs or employment. It would seem important that people have something to do. Fuller talked about giving people an income -- paying them to stay home -- and that for every industrious person who produced something useful, the advantage created would pay for 100 people who didn't work. It seems naive to think that most of us would be happy not to work. I don't really think Fuller was naive, but I'm not really clear on the details of his thinking on this.

?	xx  Aspects of Religion   % new pattern
		% For many people, religion plays many roles in their lives. This pattern simply recognizes that religion has a place in our world but that we need to deconstruct it a bit to get to the individual contributions it makes. It helps create a sense of community, supplies ritual and a mechanism for being forgiven, helps define our ethics, provides support to the poor, and is a center of power. Some of these roles work toward a world that works and other work against it, so we need to look at each separately.

?	xx  Religious Debate   % new pattern
		% This talks about the need for rational debate about religious ideas.

?	xx  Freedom to Question Beliefs   % new pattern
		% For us to fully explore the mysteries of Universe -- Fundamental Mystery (), we need to be free to look at our spiritual experiences from a fresh perspective.

?	xx  Spiritual Community   % new pattern
		% For some of us, the only thing keeping us tied to an organized religion is the community. Whether it is a church, synagogue, mosque or other community setting, we need a community of fellow humans who are trying to come to terms with the same mysteries we are. It is  fundamental to our balance and health.

*	xx  Inventory of Life   % new pattern
		% This exists in the form of the Encyclopedia of Life, and relates to the idea of the amateur scientist.

?	xx  The Story of Progress   % new pattern
		% The idea here is to write educational materials with a respect for the effort that came before. Also, to use some of the practices of the scientific community -- methods, cantradictions, possible issues, etc.

?	xx  World Success Indicators   % new pattern
		% These would be similar to economic indicators but would include things like poverty rates and the like. Very much like what the UN is doing in relation to it's Millenium Development Goals.

=================================================
 PART 2
=================================================

?	xx  Scientific Behavior   % new pattern
		% You don't have to be a scientist to approach the world in a scientific way. In the same way, a scientist can behave in ways that are not scientific. The scientists that work to defend the idea of Creationism are examples of this.

*	xx  Respectful Listener   % new pattern

*	xx  Forgiveness   % new pattern
		% I'm not sure if this a whole pattern or what. Forgiveness helps you direct your energy to more productive channels.


=================================================
 PART 3
=================================================

*	xx  Explored/Active Ideas   % new pattern
		% Ideas do not move forward unless you actually do something with them, so you have to write them down, try to build them, and generally get deep enough into them that you start to see where the limitations are. Without this process, ideas can go into a kind of stasis where they don't change much over a long time.

*	xx  Prepare for the Black Swan   % new pattern
		% a black swan is a low probability (Fuller called them low frequency) event that cannot be predicted. Some of these, like being hit by a asteroid are important. Talk of the Nation, 21 May 2007
		% preparing for a 100 year flood or huricane is another example

*	xx  A Better Mousetrap   % new pattern
		% this strategy is to look at current solutions and try to improve them in some way (new materials, higher efficiency, etc).

* 	xx  A Better Rodent-Control Industry   % new pattern
		% This strategy takes the better mousetrap to a new level where you look at the whole problem of rodent control and try to resolve systemic problems and come up with better solutions. This strategy should always be used in order to put your better mousetrap into context.

*	xx  Mouse-proof House   % new pattern
		% This approach is to go back to the original problem and see if there is a better way to frame the problem or a new family of solutions that can be explored. The objective is to make some of the old solutions completely obsolete (no mice in the hosue, no need for a mousetrap)

?	xx  The Next Design   % new pattern
		% I'm not sure what this was except that it might be related to the spiral of progress and putting an emphasis on making an improvement instead of expecting perfection.
