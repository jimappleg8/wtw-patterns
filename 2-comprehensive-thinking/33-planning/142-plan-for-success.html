<p>In order to make progress in any endeavor, you need to plan time to do what is necessary to succeed. Otherwise, you can easily spend all your time thinking about doing something and then never doing it.</p>

<p>In <i>7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>, Stephen Covey recommends a weekly review of what he calls your "roles and goals". <i>Body For Life</i> suggests a daily review of eating habits and exercise goals. My own experience suggests that I'm much more effective if I have a plan. And it has to be more than a list of things to do. It's important to look at the time available and fit items into a schedule.</p>

<p>Many of us are so busy that our time is largely scheduled for us. We go to work at a certain time, come home, do what we can, go to sleep, etc. If you want to ensure that something will get done, you have to make time for it. That's where scheduling comes in. But a plan should be flexible enough to allow for spontaneity. Be willing to bend your plan if life leads you in a different direction for a while.</p>

<p>You may be tempted to put it off until you have more free time, such as during a vacation, but in my experience, that rarely pans out. I find myself wasting my unscheduled time and being surprised by how quickly it passes.</p>

<p>There is a saying that says if you want to be sure that something will get done, give it to a busy person. Busy people tend to be good planners out of necessity. In addition, they have the advantage of inertia, they are already moving so they are more likely to get the project started.</p>

<p>It takes a significant amount of self-discipline to create your own schedule at times when the outside world doesn't dictate it for you. Whether you must schedule your whole day or just a few hours in the evening, find a way to do it so that it has authority or commitment behind it.</p>
