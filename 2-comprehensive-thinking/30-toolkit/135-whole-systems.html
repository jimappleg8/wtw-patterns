<div class="problem">
<p>At any given moment, we are part of any number of natural and human-made systems; if we want our actions to produce a specific effect, we need to understand the systems we are acting upon.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>To understand the consequences of what we do, we need to look at and try to understand how our actions affect other people and the world around us. Nothing is completely isolated. When things are connected and effect each other, they constitute a system. We need to understand the dynamics of the whole system to act intelligently and responsibly.</p>

<p>A system can be a car engine, an ecological habitat, a family, or any number of things made up of interacting components. You can't understand a system just by looking at its parts. The parts of a system interact to create behaviors that aren't predictable by looking at the parts separately. The behavior of whole systems as unpredicted by the behavior of the parts is called <i>synergy</i>.</p>

<p>Earth is operating as a single system, oblivious to our political boundaries, and the human world seems to be evolving toward a single system as well. Our understanding of systems needs to extend outside our city, states, country or continent.</p>

<p>Similarly, nature does not divide itself into categories. A water molecule doesn't care that we classify its behaviors under chemistry, physics, meteorology, hydrology, management issues, erosion, or any of the many other ways we look at water.</p>

<p>Understanding a system can be a simple as knowing what materials to combine in what quantities to create a desired alloy, or it is as complex as trying to understand what factors to change to bring about world peace.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>
