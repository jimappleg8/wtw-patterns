<div class="problem">
<p>We can accomplish a lot by doing things in a "quick and dirty" way, but in the long run, cutting corners can catch up with us.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>A best practice is a prescribed method of doing something that has been shown by experience to create the largest benefit with the fewest negative consequences.</p>

<p>In some disciplines, the quality of work is directly related to how closely best practices were followed. For example, the scientific method is essentially a collection of best practices designed to minimize the effect of human biases in discovering facts about Universe. The value of a scientific conclusion is based on how closely the scientific method was followed by the researchers. If the practices were sloppy, the data can't be trusted.</p>

<p>These patterns are an attempt to define best practices for thinking comprehensively.</p>

<p>Best practices tend to be the most thorough way of doing something and as a result they can take more time and effort. In the kind of time constraints that we face in everyday working conditions, it can be very tempting to take shortcuts so we can get the job done. The reasoning is that you can take care of any consequences later on.</p>

<p>Best practices sometimes take the form of laws or rules, though not all rules reflect best practices. If you are the kind of person who resists rules, take a second look and see if they are best practices in disguise.</p>

<p>Determining best practices is a tricky business. They usually come out of years of trial and error and from the experiences of many people. The reason for this is that it is very difficult to understand how specific practices will create consequences in the future, especially if we have never dealt with the consequences ourselves.</p>

<p>The longer we do something without experiencing any negative consequences, the more likely we are to consider it a good practice, even if it isn't.</p>

<p>For example, it's very easy to imagine that you are a good driver if you haven't had any accidents, but that is not necessarily a safe conclusion. It may just be that you've been lucky, or that you drive in very forgiving conditions such as a mostly deserted roads. It may be that the drivers around you are giving you a wide berth or are effectively reacting to your mistakes. The point is that there may be negative consequences to your practices of which you are not aware.</p>

<p>The thing that can make this a tragic flaw is that we like to feel that we are especially good at some things and our pride can close our minds. Be wary of the thought that you are exempt from the same rules as other. You may feel that you can get away with it, but it will likely be at the expense of others, and it may well catch up to you.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

</div> <!-- discussion -->

<div class="solution">
<p>Always try to go beyond "what works" and look for the best way to do something.</p>
</div>

</div> <!-- pattern -->

<div class="posttext">
<p>The habit of looking for better ways to do things is at the heart of self-improvement as well as making the world a better place, but you need to be willing to question the processes, techniques, and other things you know</p>
