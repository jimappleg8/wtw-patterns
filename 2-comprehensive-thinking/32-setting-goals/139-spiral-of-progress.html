<div class="problem">
<p>At first glance, it looks like all the problems have already been solved.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>We live in a world where the problems that need to be solved are not very obvious, at least those of us living in developed countries where most people enjoy a high standard of living. It seems that everything we could need has already been invented or is likely to be unveiled by one of the major multi-national corporations sometime soon. And yet, we don't live in a perfect world. The reason is that the solutions we have now are imperfect. The truth is, everything we do could be done better. Buckminster Fuller put it this way in <i>Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth</i>:

<blockquote>"I am enthusiastic over humanity's extraordinary and sometimes very timely ingenuities. If you are in a shipwreck and all the boats are gone, a piano top buoyant enough to keep you afloat that comes along makes a fortuitous life preserver. But this is not to say that the best way to design a life preserver is in the form of a piano top. I think that we are clinging to a great many piano tops in accepting yesterday's fortuitous contrivings as constituting the only means for solving a given problem."</blockquote>

<p>The human-designed world is a collection of less-than-perfect solutions to problems that face humans living in the natural world: the need for shelter, food, clothing, transportation, a place to walk without getting our shoes dirty, and place to work, etc. That these solutions exist is the great human achievement. That most of these solutions create new problems in themselves is testament to the fact that our technologies are not very comprehensive in scope and nowhere near as sophisticated as the technologies of Nature. Some would argue that we should throw out our technology in favor of Nature, but the existence of technology is not the problem; the problem is that the technology is insufficiently designed.</p>

<p>Humans are so adaptable that we've come to think of many of these incomplete solutions as the only way to do something. We don't notice how difficult it is to do something until someone creates something better: a better tool, a better method, a better mousetrap. There is a huge opportunity available to anyone who can design a better way to do something and build it. On the other hand, there is a great demand for people who can navigate through the mess of current technology and make it work.</p>

<p>Interestngly, the perfect solution can never be reached. Once you create a better solution, the dynamics change and the solution begins to show its weaknesses. Progress must be a spiral. We rethink the way we do things and at the end of each cycle, we end up with a better solution, winding our way toward perfection. If we wait to acheive perfection then nothing will get done. Use of this and other patterns, however, can help you maximize the benefits of your ideas.</p>

<p>Ideally, the world would be continuously improving, but that is not always the case. There is a great deal of emphasis on newness, but new is not always better. As a result, we spend a great deal of energy and don't progress much.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>
