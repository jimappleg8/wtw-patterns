<li>I use "comprehensive thinking" to refer to what Fuller called "comprehensive anticipatory design science" and what others shorten to "design science". In looking at what Fuller meant by "comprehensive anticipatory design science", I realized that a rational argument could be made for shortening the phrase as I have.
<p>Besides being easier to say, comprehensive thinking encompasses the other parts of Fuller's phrase. It can be easily stated that comprehensive thinking would, of course, be anticipatory: if you don't anticipate, then your thinking simply is not comprehensive.</p>
<p>The act of designing is a form of thinking, specifically problem-solving, so of course, comprehensive thinking would involve design. The other meaning of design, as a noun -- an object or plan that has been designed -- is also a form of thought. In a sense, it is thought solidified into an artifact, and this can also be encompassed in comprehensive thinking.</p>
<p>Science is a system of thinking designed to improve our chances of being correct in our conclusions. The methods off science fit nicely into comprehensive thinking. As for the conclusions of science, they are also included as a reliable source off knowledge.</p>
<p>Beyond Fuller's phrase, I've found that "comprehensive thinking" is a concept that can encompass everything we know about what it means to know something. In other words, the patterns of comprehensive thinking represent everything we know about discovering, learning, thinking, knowing, building, and designing our Universe.</p>

<li>In the <i>World Design Science Decade</i> documents, there is a section called "Comprehensive Thinking" which would seem to validate the use of the phrase, but it is presented as a component of Design Science, so I'm not so sure that both concepts aren't needed.</li>
