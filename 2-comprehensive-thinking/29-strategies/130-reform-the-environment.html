<p>This pattern is based on Fuller's assertion that it is better to change the environment, bringing about spontaneous changes in people and their behavior, than it is to try to change people directly.</p>

<p>I always thought that this was one of many strategies that could be used to bring about change, but based on his writing, Fuller seemed to be convinced that this was the only effective way to bring about the desired changes. The reasoning is that our lives are already full of compensating behaviors that help us cope with a world that is insufficiently designed. If you try to change people's behavior, you are not addressing the root of the problem. You must focus on the design flaws that are bringing about the behavior.</p>

<p>I think it's worth pointing out here what we mean by environment. With all the discussion about saving the "environment", you might think that we mean the natural systems of Earth, but in this context, we are talking about the conditions in which a person finds herself living in and having to cope with every day. For most of us in the industrialized world, that has more to do with the human world than the natural systems of Earth. The environment includes our homes, the built world we travel through, our workplace, the laws we are subject to, the tools we use everyday, the messages we perceive in the media and the built world, our language, culture, traditions, religious ideas, and all the other things that humans have designed and created in the world. So by reforming the environment, we are essentially redesigning the human-built world, ideally in a way that does not interfere with the workings of the natural systems of Earth.</p>
