   <div class="tabbertab" title="Pattern">

<div class="context">
<p><a href="../../0-world/15-intellectual-resources/047-universe.html" class="pattern-name">Universe (47)</a> is the aggregate of all communicated human experiences. This pattern helps to establish ways that you can expand Universe by sharing your own experience.</p>
</div>

<div class="pattern">

<div class="problem">
<p>Human lives are rich with experiences unique to each individual, but those experiences are lost when a person dies, unless that person communicates them to the world at large.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<ul>
<li>Think about all the people who have lived before us. Each of them represents a huge body of experiences. Much of that experience has been lost because it was never communicated. Some of it was written down and has survived the passage of time; some was passed on verbally to their children; but most of it was lost. It may be that these experiences live on in the souls of those who have passed, but they remain unavailable to those of us left here on Earth.</li>
<li>Many people think that they don't have anything to contribute. They may be blue collar workers who think writing is for the more educated, but they are often the people who are closest to the daily life-support functions of our planet. They likely have insights into how things could be improved that are gleaned from a lifetime of experience.</li>
<li>One important way to communicate an idea is to build it, to create an artifact. There is no better way to show that an idea will work that to build a working prototype of it. Written words are artifacts in themselves, but they represent ideas rather than embody them. It's possible to write about an idea that has no hope of working, but you can't build idea that can't be built. The laws of nature are a tough critic.</li>
<li>Anyone who has tried to learn more about their ancestors has experienced just how much knowledge is lost when a person dies. As soon as you start looking for information about people who are out of the direct experience of you or your parents, the amount of information goes down significantly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore:</p>

</div> <!-- discussion -->

<div class="solution">
<p>Devise a system for recording your experiences and insights in a way that will make them available to as many people as possible for as long as possible.</p>
</div>

</div> <!-- pattern -->

<div class="posttext">
<p>Write as though you were explaining the ideas to someone else -- <a href="../../1-individual/17-getting-started/057-interruptable-line-of-thought.html" class="pattern-name">Interruptable Line of Thought (57)</a>.</p>
