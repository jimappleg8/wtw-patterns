<div class="problem">
<p>The world is a human invention that is intended to improve our ability to survive and thrive on Earth; it is working well for some people and failing completely for others.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>For the purposes of this book, "Earth" and "World" are two distinct things. Earth consists of the physical planet and its natural systems. The World is made up of objects and systems designed and built by humans. Earth and the World are each affected by the other in important ways, so they are not independent from one another, but in the context of an exploration of how we can create a better world, it can be useful to note that we are not trying to improve Earth directly: we are looking to improve the human inventions that have been superimposed upon Earth.</p>

<p>As a human-designed system, the human world is something we can change in an attempt to improve it. As it is now, it works for some people, meaning some people are enjoying a certain amount of success as a result of the current design, but it doesn't work for everyone. This pattern states that we should be striving for a world that works for everyone, not just a world that works for our country, state, community or family. Why we think this is possible and how it might happen are the subjects of other patterns.</p>

<p>The human world, as currently designed, is rather dysfunctional. As a result, we have to learn how to deal with its idiosyncrasies, and mold our behavior to cope with it. It's similar to having a car that is old and starting to fall apart. You learn to deal with the window that sticks and the door handle that's broken. We can learn how to deal with these things, but it takes a great deal more energy and attention than if we were driving a new, well-designed car that simply works.</p>

<p>The world is a complex system with many parts interacting in myriad ways to create the working world we see. People trying to understand the dynamics of complex systems have identified a phenomenon they call <i>emergence</i>. Simply put, a complex system is more than the sum of its parts; it behaves in ways that are unpredictable by looking at just the parts of the system. Buckminster Fuller called this phenomenon <i>synergy</i>.</p>

<p>The world is so complex, we can't know for sure what a World That Works will look like until it emerges. Part of the question is how do we encourage that property to emerge? The answer is that we can work to remove or replace systems that are actively working against success for all humanity while working to ensure that we don't create new ones. This is not an easy task. The world is dynamic and changing and some of these systems do great things for the people they help. We don't want to simply throw them away; we have to redesign them or rethink them so that they can do even more.</p>

<p>I'm speaking very generally of these systems now, but they are innumerable in the special cases of our lives: governments and government programs, laws, finacial systems, educational institutions, transportation systems, communication technologies, urban plans, homes, offices, businesses, even social norms and the ways we think about the world around us. In other words, the human world that we live in. No part of it is perfect; all the parts influence the whole in unintended and undesirable ways, and they all need our constant attention if we want to create a World that Works.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

</div> <!-- discussion -->

<div class="solution">
<p>Work toward creating a world that works for all humanity, not through force or political edict, but by helping create the environment necessary for it to emerge spontaneously.</p>
</div>

</div> <!-- pattern -->

<div class="posttext">
<p>To create a world that works for everyone, we need to recognize that it's possible -- <a href="../../0-world/01-main-goals/004-success-as-the-norm.html" class="pattern-name">Success as the Norm (4)</a> -- and we need to ensure that no one benefits at the expense of another -- <a href="../../0-world/01-main-goals/002-everyone-lifted-up.html" class="pattern-name">Everyone Lifted Up (2)</a> -- or the planet -- <a href="../../0-world/01-main-goals/006-stewards-of-earth.html" class="pattern-name">Stewards of Earth (6)</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Our only real option is success for everyone. We can't sustain the alternative, and we can't justify it from a moral standpoint.</li>
<li>Earth is already working just fine; it's the human built <i>world</i> that we need to look at if we want to survive and thrive on Earth.</li>
<li>The act of creating a world that works is the act of freeing us from the behaviors that reduce our freedom and frustrate our efforts at being complete humans.</li>
