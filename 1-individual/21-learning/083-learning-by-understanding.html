<div class="problem">
<p>Memorizing something is not the same as learning it.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>This is based on the quote from Richard Feynman's book; something like "Most people don't learn by understanding. They learn by some other way, by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile."</p>

<p>When I was going to school, there was very little emphasis on understanding a topic in any kind of deep way.<sup>1</sup> I was expected to simply remember what was told to me, either in a lecture or in my books, and that was called learning.</p>

<p>You might choose to call that a form of learning, but really, it is simply memorizing. And most of what I was told in school wasn't even very well memorized. I forgot most of it soon after the test.</p>

<p>Memory is very important to learning; we could learn anything without it, but learning requires that we take what we've been told and integrate it with the rest of our knowledge. We need to connect it to other knowledge and experience, and we need to do the same things with information we're told that we do with direct experience: decide how much we trust it, check it against what we already know, and look for inconsistencies, etc.</p>

<p>Matt talked to me about how he learns something new. He approaches the subject from as many directions as possible, reading multiple sources about it and building his knowledge through repetition and making connections. I think one interesting point is that by reading multiple sources, he gets different perspectives, each of which may connect into his current knowledge a different way. For example, if he's learning about a new airplane, he might read the military's description of it which might tap into his knowledge of air battle strategy. Another article might describe the engines which might tap into his engineering knowledge. Another article might emphasize how this design came to be from a historical perspective. Each of these perspectives creates hooks into his existing knowledge and makes the new information more integrated.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<li>Maybe the name should be "Learning by Integration" since what you're trying to do is integrate the new knowledge into your total understanding of Universe.</li>
<li>I think it's the wrong approach to describe the education system as not providing understandiing to its students. A school is in a difficult position in that it has to teach large numbers of children the best way it can. Understanding something requires integrating information into the student's specific body of knowledge, and it is the responsibility of the student to do that work. The one thing I might say about schools is that the process of what it takes to understand something is not well-taught. I don't remember any study skills lessons at all when I was in school. In addition, there could probably be better tools for helping students understand, but perhaps they still need to be invented.</li>
<li>I think the US education's emphasis on "retention levels" tells of a mind-set toward memorization.</li>
