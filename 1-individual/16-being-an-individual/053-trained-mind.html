<div class="problem">
<p>Most of the scientific discoveries and advances happening now exist in a realm that cannot be directly experienced by our senses, but understanding and using these discoveries is critical for creating the world we need.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<blockquote>"...inasmuch as the great reality is all invisible, the only way man is able to treat with it is by the trained mind.... So this all has to do with the fact that man, in order to be able to cope with reality, simply has to have that kind of trained mind. So nothing is more essential to our revolution right now than the trained mind."
<br />-- RBF, Synergetics Dictionary, A-E, p.584</blockquote>

<p>It is not just thinking that you need to learn to do, but it is a particular set of disciplines that lead to original and more accurate thinking -- a trained mind.</p>

<p>Looking at what Fuller is saying, it seems like the idea of being able to deal with the invisible is what makes a trained mind. This is much more than just concepts like electricity, which we use but cannot see.</p>

<p>How do we deal with the invisible? We observe the effects of it. We may not be able to see radio waves, but we can experience them using a receiver. How they were originally discovered, I'm not sure. It may be that an experiment revealed an unexpected result and it led to radio. Or it could be that as electromagnetic waves were better understood, we extrapolated that a range of frequencies, that we now call radio waves, existed and went looking for them.</p>

<p>The invisible is not just about science. It also involves things like being able to identify and question the assumptions behind what we do. To see what has become so ingrained in our world-view that it is invisible.</p>
