<div class="problem">
<p>Just as our current understanding of the world is imperfect, so was the understanding of those who came before us. If we simply learn what their thoughts were without questioning them, we risk blindly accepting their mistakes as truth.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<blockquote>"Initiative can neither be created nor delegated. It can only spring from the self-determining individual who decides that the wisdom of others is not always better than his own." -- R. Buckminster Fuller, <i>I Seem to be a Verb</i></blockquote>

<p>By the time we're 20 years old, most of us have spent most of our lives being told what to think. For those of us who were successful in such a situation -- doing well in school<sup>1</sup> -- it can be very difficult to switch gears and begin thinking for ourselves.</p>

<p>My realization that I needed to begin doing my own thinking came in my 20s. I was trying to make sense of the world, and I began to realize that the things I had been told -- for instance about environmental problems -- couldn't possible all be true. About the same time, I was asked to explain my opinion about a subject and I couldn't do it. I had accepted someone else's conclusions without understanding the reasons behind it.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

</div> <!-- discussion -->

<div class="solution">
<p>Exercise your right to think for yourself and have confidence in your abilities. Examine the wisdom of others as closely as you do your own, and don't be too surprised when your insights turn out to be more correct.</p>
</div>

</div> <!-- pattern -->

<div class="posttext">
<p>Doing your own thinking includes taking a fresh look at your assumptions &mdash; <a href="../../1-individual/21-learning/084-rethinking.html" class="pattern-name">Rethinking (84)</a>, and constantly testing what others tell you against your own experience &mdash; <a href="../../1-individual/24-cleaning-your-universe/099-active-mind.html" class="pattern-name">Active Mind (99)</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<ol>
<li>Doing well in school is not necessarily due to being able to assimilate what people tell you instead of thinking for yourself. You can see school as a game of telling the teacher what he or she expects while keeping your own thinking to yourself. I suspect that Matt Wall approached school somewhat along those lines.</li>
