<h1><span class="num">93</span> Start with Universe</h1>

<div class="context">
<p>To create a world that works, we need to look at it in its context. This pattern explores how we can get a useful perspective.</p>
</div>

<div class="pattern">

<div class="problem">

<p class="editor">This pattern is pretty convoluted and it's not clear what I am trying to get at. Fuller talked about Starting With Universe and that's why I have it, but I'm having trouble understanding where it should be. I think it may need to be part of the process part of the book.</p>

<p>Open-ended problems, where the limits of the problem are not well-defined, are almost impossible to solve sufficiently.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>These open-ended problems are sometimes called "wicked problems" and most of the problems we face today as a species this kind of problem.</p>

<p>Looking at just our planet, Earth, is not enough. We need to look at ourselves from the largest perspective possible: Universe. Universe consists of everything humanity knows about "objective" Universe.</p>

<p>Fuller was pretty clear about what he meant by "start with Universe." It was a way to ensure that all the relevant knowledge about a problem would be included in your thinking. Literally, start by contemplating Universe and work your way to Earth with the problem in mind. Make sure you include any forces that are acting on Earth, like solar radiation or the gravitational pull from the Moon, and consider them in your analysis. To Fuller, the process of thinking was to start with Universe and eliminate irrelevancies. <span class="editor">That's why I think this should be moved to the process part of the book.</span></p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

</div> <!-- discussion -->

<div class="solution">
<p>Approach these kinds of problems from the largest concepts to the smallest, with the largest possible concept being Universe.</p>
</div>

</div> <!-- pattern -->

<div class="posttext">
<p>Narrow the scope of the problem by progressively eliminating irrelevancies -- <a href="../../2-comprehensive-thinking/32-setting-goals/141-sculpted-scope.html" class="pattern-name">Sculpted Scope (141)</a>.</p>

<div class="notes">
<ul>
<li>Among scientists, Universe is divided into "knowable Universe" and "visible Universe." The visible Universe is that part of Universe that we can see, but there is a large portion of Universe from which the light has not reached our planet. We can theorize that these portions of Universe exist, but we cannot observe them. From our perspective of Universe as the aggregate of human experience, both the visible and knowable Universes are relevant. With our definition of Universe, we have to include all experiences, even if they are not part of the observable Universe, and that includes all of the human ideas that have nothing to do with reality.</li>
