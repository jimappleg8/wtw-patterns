<div class="pattern">

<div class="problem">
<p>It's an illusion that we understand why things happen. We probably can understand what's happening enough to function in a given situation, but for us to assume that we know people's motives, what they are thinking or feeling and why they're thinking and acting the way they are, is ludicrous.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>This assumption that we know leads to all kinds of problems, from jumping to conclusions to being hurt by what we imagined.</p>

<p>We like to feel like we understand the reasons for things. Even when there's no real evidence that there was any reason for what happened and it appears random, we look for reasons. In most cases, we just don't have enough information to know. In some of those cases, it might be possible to gather enough information to make a reasonable guess, but sometimes there's just no way to know. A random injury or death may have a reason behind it, but we're not privy to that information. Yet, we still try to come up with an explanation that is acceptable to us.</p>

<p>I think it's much easier to understand <i>what</i> happened than it is to know <i>why</i> it happened. Why something happens almost always involves understanding motives or it touches on chance, fate, or circumstance. It also gets quickly into the realm of philosophy and faith. Some believe that there is no coincidence (i.e. everything happens for a reason), and some believe there's nothing but chance. Most of us are probably somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<li>I feel like I need a pattern that makes explicit the idea that we just don't know much about any situation.</li>
<li>There are two clear aspects of this: we don't know why other people do things and we don't know why things happen in a cosmic sense. I don't think the problems statement is clear on this.</li>
<li>This is related to reasonable doubt in law.</li>
