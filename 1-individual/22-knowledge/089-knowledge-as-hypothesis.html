<h1><span class="num">89</span> Knowledge as Hypothesis**</h1>

   <div class="tabber">
   <div class="tabbertab" title="Pattern">

<div class="context">
<p>to refine your Personal Universe -- <a href="../../1-individual/16-being-an-individual/052-accurate-personal-universe.html" class="pattern-name">Accurate Personal Universe (52)</a>, you need to maintain an open mind -- <a href="../../1-individual/17-cleaning-your-universe/083-open-mind.html" class="pattern-name">Open Mind (83)</a>. This pattern looks at how to keep your knowledge flexible so you can integrate new information more easily.</p>
</div>

<div class="pattern">

<div class="problem">
<p>When we decide that we "know" something, we stop thinking about it and start defending it.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>What we call knowledge is really just our best guess at what is true. It's a set of hypotheses that interconnect to create a theory of Universe. Answers are just highly probable hypotheses.</p>

<p>It is your responsibility as a thinking human being to subject these hypotheses to rigorous testing. Do the ideas match your experience? Is there another idea that you think explains your experience better? What is your current assumption? Do the new ideas you encounter work better than your current assumptions?</p>

<p>We take great comfort in what we "know." It can be very scary to put yourself in a position where you can honestly say "I don't know anything." And yet it's not that big  from "x is true" to "my experience suggests that x is true." We probably do that quite a bit already, but only with certain types of knowledge. We need only apply it across the board. We don't end up having less capability; we just have a more accurate and continually fresh perspective on that capability. It is that perspective that allows us to learn more easily -- not defending what we "know." It is akin to how we saw the world as children.</p>

<p>Discovering what we don't know can be a fun and exciting experience. There is motivation to fill in the hole, and the fact that we recognize the hole means that what we learn is relevant to our knowledge. The realization "I don't know" can really be seen as a gift and something to treasure.</p>

<p>There is no room in this way of thinking for blindly defending "what you know." All new information is welcomed as a challenge to what you hold as true. You can use that challenge to grow.</p>

<p>Treating knowledge as a set of hypotheses is not all that difficult. It consists of admitting to yourself that what you know might be wrong, that at the very least it is probably only part of the Truth. Once this is done consciously, then "knowledge" is subjected to scrutiny as it comes up. You develop a habit of questioning what you know as you re-encounter it in daily life and/or in the process of thinking comprehensively.<p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

</div> <!-- discussion -->

<div class="solution">
<p>Recognize that what you "know" is always only part of a larger story and keep an attitude of continuous learning.</p>

<ul>
<li>How does opinion tie into all of this? In my dictionary, they describe three words that represent subtle differences in "a belief or judgement that rests on grounds insufficient to produce certainty." The other words are "sentiment" which usually has an emotional association, and "view" which is said to be an "estimate of something, an intellectual judgement, a critical survey based on a mental examination."</li>
<li>hypothesis: 1. a proposition or set of propositions set forth as an explanation for the occurrence of some specified group of phenomena, either asserted merely as a provisional conjecture to guide investigation (working hypothesis) or accepted as highly probable in the light of the established facts." Random House Dictionary</li>
<li>I guess I like hypothesis because it implies an active search for Truth -- <a href="../../1-individual/22-knowledge/091-levels-of-knowing.html" class="pattern-name">Levels of Knowing (91)</a>.</li>
<li>This relates to p. 116 - ? in "Clear thinking": 'Mistaking Evidence for Proof'. "We must remember that in real life the existence of absolute proof leading to complete certainty is for all practical purposes impossible to attain."</li>
<li>look up on NPR notes: A study found that the people who knew the least about a topic tended to overestimate their knowledge. (6:17)</li>
<li>3/6/98 -- Stereotypes are the result of lazy thinking that allows a person to dismiss another person with a "preknown." It is an excuse for someone to not get to know someone on a personal level. It is a very good example of people not basing their knowledge on experience. Stereotypes are latched on to by people who don't know and don't want to know and are passed on by the same.</li>
<li>10/24/98 -- Stereotypes are not the result of the search for Truth. They are the result of people's natural fear of the unknown which I'm starting to think is aggravated by non-comprehensive thinking.</li>
