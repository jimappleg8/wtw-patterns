<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>As a young college student, I decided that humanity needed to be saved and it looked like I was the one who was going to have to do it. Like many of us that age, I was overwhelmed by my first taste of reality. I was just starting to see what the world was like beyond the protective shell my parents had provided. The gentle world I'd grown up in turned out to have serious problems, and they seemed to develop and multiply overnight. I couldn't believe  that the adults of the previous generation -- especially my parents -- could have let things get so bad.</p>

<p>It was disturbingly easy to identify where things were going wrong. Back then, as they are now, the world's problems were broadcast all over the nightly news, published in magazines, and highlighted in our classes. On a college campus, discussing the ills of the world and responding with righteous indignation is practically a rite of passage. To my tender mind, the solutions were painfully obvious -- just stop doing the bad things. Stop polluting; stop cutting down trees; stop making nuclear bombs. Stop! Stop! Stop!</p>

<p>For those of you who may be in the midst of such thinking, let me offer a slightly different perspective: your parents and the millions of others who came before us have worked hard to create the best world they could. They deserve our gratitude for what they have accomplished and what they have given us. Paradoxically, most of our current problems like overpopulation, pollution, climate change, and environmental degradation are the unintended consequences of their success. Many of us enjoy a higher standard of living than any medieval king ever dreamed of. Now we just have to figure out how to extend that standard to everyone without doing it at the expense of others or the planet.</p>

<p>In many ways, the problems we face today are similar to the problems faced by previous generations. Some of the problems have been around as long as humans have been humans. The primary difference today is in the scale of the consequences. Our Earth is in danger of changing in unpredictable ways, and billions of people will be affected if we don't find better ways to do things. We have to be better than those before us. We have to find more sophisticated solutions to our problems. Luckily, over thousands of years, humanity has discovered a great deal about our Earth and Universe, and we have all that hard-won knowledge to use as a starting point.</p>

<p>This will be the only place in this book that I talk about the "problems" we face. As I mentioned, there are plenty of people who will happily tell you what is going wrong. You don't need another voice in that chorus. My goal is to talk about what we know about finding solutions. The reality, stated simply, is that our world is complex. There will always be problems to solve and the solutions will never be as simple or obvious as they first seem. But we are up to the challenge. It is my hope that this book will do its small part in bringing forth our bright future.</p>
