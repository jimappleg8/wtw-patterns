<div class="problem">
<p>Humans have been taking over the surface of the planet and converting a wide variety of environments to our preferred niche: open savanna. Unfortunately, many of the other species living on Earth with us require a different habitat to survive.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>In a radio interview on NPR, Edward O. Wilson talked about what constitutes the human niche:</p>

<blockquote>"The human niche, the thing that our brains were built for, was to live primarily on the African savanna as highly social primates, even more so than our closest cousins among the monkeys and apes, and to be vegetarian in part but also more than other species closely related to us including most of those monkeys and apes to be turning to meat. We're getting to be good predators; we're probably also scavengers so we're likely dealing with ten percent or more of our calories coming in that way. So that's our niche. Open terrain, scattered trees, copses and so on and that's where we fitted in and it was all we could do, those ancient hominids of which, you know, there probably were not more than a few hundred thousand at any given time, maybe even less in periods of time. They fit in very well and they weren't really upsetting any the the balance of anything. But then somehow, somewhere, which is all a matter of dispute among the evolutionary biologists and the anthropologists, we began this runaway development of the cerebrum, intelligence, technology, and pretty soon, without losing our appetite, you know, for meat and for breeding and producing more of ourselves, and the ability to turn a large part of the natural world that was not savanna into savanna -- we call it farms and yards and lawns -- soon we are sweeping over the world and we're simply trying to make the whole world our niche, and that, in a nutshell, is the problem, we neglected almost all of those other species which have been keeping things in balance and harmony for us and we're doing it in a way, we're taking away their services, we're taking away the many opportunities that understanding these species offer us, and we are generally messing up big time."</blockquote>

<p>Therefore:</p>

</div> <!-- discussion -->

<div class="solution">
<p>Make a concerted effort to leave room and habitat for plants and animals that fill different niches so other species can survive. Where possible, allow converted areas to revert to their previous habitats, or actively try to recreate those habitats.</p>
