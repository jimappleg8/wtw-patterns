<div class="pattern">

<div class="problem">
<p>There is an implicit assumption at the heart of many of our institutions that it is normal for some people to be a physical and economic success while others are left poor and starving. Success is seen as an achievement of the exceptional with most of us doomed to failure.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<blockquote>"...But from now on, I think we must all assume that Malthus was wrong and thus it is normal for man to be a physical and economic success... that it is abnormal for any to be a failure...." (RBF, <i>Utopia or Oblivion</i>)</blockquote>

<p>We need to change the assumption that the norm is failure if we want to reach a point where everyone succeeds. We need to know that it is more than just possible; it needs to be seen as the way Universe works.</p>

<p>Fuller talks about Universe trying to make us all successful. I'm not sure what evidence there is that shows we are destined for success, but I also don't know what evidence -- other than historical precedence -- that shows we are destined for failure either. We have failed before, but this is a different time. We can now do so much with so little, we are capable of success for everyone.</p>

<p>Realizing that capability to provide for everyone is the thing we need to be striving for, but we will not do that unless we understand that it is possible. Throughout our history, our ancestors had to deal with scarcity. The "fact" that there are not enough resources to go around is part of our intellectual heritage, reinforced by generations of experience. What we need to realize is that things have changed.</p>

<p>If we assume for the time being that success for all humanity is possible, there is no reason that any human should fail in a system designed by and for humanity. It doesn't make sense to build in failure for some in a system that is no longer win/lose. The competition that we used to assume -- fighting for the survival of the fittest -- can become cooperation and competition in its non-destructive form where we push each other to do better.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<div class="solution">
<p>Find solutions for world problems based on the assumption that we can all succeed. Our future depends not on survival of the fittest, but on all of humanity thriving.</p>

<li>I think some might argue that Survival of the Fittest is a natural law and not something we can transcend the way I describe. My response: the idea that some of us are better than others and therefore deserve to survive -- an idea that is called social Darwinism -- is a gross misapplication of the theory of evolution. It is nothing but a justification for bigotry and taking advantage of others for one's own benefit.</li>
