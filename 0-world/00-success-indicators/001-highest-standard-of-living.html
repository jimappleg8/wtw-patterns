<h1><span class="num">1</span> Highest Standard of Living</h1>

<div class="context">
<p>One of ways we can tell if we are all being lifted up -- <a href="../../0-world/00-success-indicators/001-everyone-lifted-up.html" class="pattern-name">Everyone Lifted Up (1)</a> -- is by measuring the quality of life enjoyed by people around the world; this pattern describes how that is quantified.</p>
</div>

<div class="pattern">

<div class="problem">
<p>Success can be measured in a number of ways, but they all come together in what we call a "standard of living." This is the baseline for what is considered an acceptable existence on Earth.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>In developed nations, most of even the poorest people enjoy a higher standard of living then that of a medieval king. We don't have to lower anyone's standard of living for all of us to be successful. We need to improve everyone's standard until we all reach the highest level possible. To do that, we need to understand what constitutes a high standard of living.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of evidence that suggests that the kind of consumption seen in the U.S. does not bring happiness or contentment. Once basic material needs are met, other kinds of factors begin to affect how satisfied we are with our lives.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

</div> <!-- discussion -->

<div class="solution">
<p>Look for ways to improve everyone's standard of living, keeping in mind that a great life does not necessarily require rampant consumption.</p>
</div>

</div> <!-- pattern -->

<div class="notes">
<ul>
<li>It seems premature to talk about a high standard of living whan so many don't get even basic needs met. I'm not sure if that is addressed in this pattern or another one. In some ways, Basic Needs are just one component of a standard of living and a more fine-grained pattern. It may be that they belong farther along in the book.</li>
<li>I'm starting to think that this pattern needs to be merged with Everyone Lifted Up. It just defines how we can measure success. There is no problem statement I can see right now. (Sonya dsagreed on this, so I have left it for now.)</li>
