<div class="context">
<p>for a world that works for all humanity to emerge &mdash; <a href="../../0-world/00-top/001-world-that-works.html" class="pattern-name">World That Works (1)</a> &mdash;  it has to be done in a way that doesn't threaten the people who are enjoying success in the current world.</p>
</div>

<div class="pattern">

<div class="problem">
<p>We tend to think of helping others much like Robin Hood, transferring wealth from those who have it to those who need it, but that approach leads to everyone losing.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>There are two ideas that lead to the Robin Hood mentality. One is that the rich are rich because they have exploited the poor of the world and taken what should have rightfully gone to the poor. In other words, I'm poor because you are rich. Certainly there are instances where this is the case, but as I will explain, it doesn't have to be that way. The other idea is essentially the other side of the coin: the idea that some people will need to suffer for the others to survive and thrive. It serves as a kind of justification for those who exploit others for their own gain.</p>

<p>Both of these views are based on the assumption that wealth is a limited resource and there is only so much of it to go around. In game theory and economics (two disciplines that share a number of ideas) this is called a <i>zero-sum</i> situation. It can be argued, however, that wealth is limitless and can be increased to the point that there is enough for everyone -- <a href="../../0-world/05-macroeconomics/019-wealth-as-capacity.html" class="pattern-name">Wealth as Capacity (19)</a>. This is important because it fundamentally changes our working assumptions about how the world should be designed. Most of our current systems assume a situation of scarcity, a place where only the fittest survive and our primary goal is to get our share of the pie. A world in which abundance is the norm is a very different thing.</p>

<p>Once it becomes clear that wealth is not zero-sum, it becomes difficult to justify any enterprise where some benefit at the expense of others, in either direction: the rich benefiting at the expense of the poor or the poor benefiting at the expense of the rich. Such schemes should be avoided. Instead, we should embrace strategies in which everyone benefits at the expense of no one.</p>

<p>This does not assume that everyone will have equal success. That may occur when a World That Works emerges, but it will be uneven until then, at least. What we are looking for is for everyone to be on an upward trend.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

</div> <!-- discussion -->

<div class="solution">
<p>Look for solutions that are indiscriminately beneficial and lift everyone up so that everyone is on an upward curve toward success.</p>

<ul>
<li>What does such a scheme look like?</li>
<li>An example of how this is playing out is in the idea of "emerging economies" and how many countries are moving from developing to developed. This is turning out to be a great thing for existing developed countries because they represent a new market for our goods and services. Everyone is lifted up. The old model of development where resources are consumed to drive the growing economy must be re-thought, however, because consumption at that scale could be catastrophic to the world at large.</li>
