<p>I'm still working on this one. There is some evidence that would suggest that having a standing military leads to more war, so I think I may want to rename this "World Militia" with the idea that the various autonomous regions would supply citizen soldiers whenever it was required to keep the peace or stop an abuse of power.</p>

<p>Perhaps, though, we would need to rethink the military's purpose with a greater emphasis on service. I had a dream a while back in which I was part of a military ship with all the vast resources implied by that, but our mission was to help people in places where a natural disaster has struck. Star Trek is like this. There is military might, but that is not the first reason for their existence.</p>

<p>I feel like there may be some within the U.S. military that see their role as diplomats and relief workers. In places like Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers are taking on roles that go well beyond combat.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

<ul>
<li>I think I will need to rename this to something that is the opposite. There is an author (I have the reference somewhere) that discusses how having a standing army is one of the worst things we can do. I guess George Washington, among others, warned against it. It establishes a need for war. You can't justify a standing military unless you have an enemy. Instead, there should be a mechanism for citizens to form into an army when needed and disbanded later, like a militia. We will still need to defend ourselves from individuals who decide that their need for power trumps the rights of others.</li>
<li>I need to look for information about non-lethal military and that kind of thing. "Non-lethal Military" might be a pattern in it's own right.</li>
