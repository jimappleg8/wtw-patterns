<div class="context">
<p>we cannot develop in a sustainable way -- <a href="../../0-world/00-success-indicators/004-ongoing-success.html" class="pattern-name">Ongoing Success (4)</a> -- if we do it at the expense of the planet we live on.</p>
</div>

<div class="pattern">

<div class="problem">
<p>Earth is the planet that sustains us. The human world is built upon and within the natural systems that Earth provides. As we are utterly dependent on Earth for our survival, it makes sense that we should take care of it.</p>
</div>

<div class="discussion">

<p>As the only species on Earth capable of significantly altering Earth's natural systems, it falls on us to be keepers of the planet. This should come naturally as taking care of the planet is the same as taking care of ourselves:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>"What we really are is, first of all, the whole of our body. And although our bodies are bounded with skin, and we can differentiate between outside and inside, they cannot exist except in a certain kind of natural environment. Obviously a body requires air, and the air must be within a certain temperature range. The body also requires certain kinds of nutrition. So in order to occur the body must be on a mild and nutritive planet with just enough oxygen in the atmosphere spinning regularly around in a harmonious and rhythmical way near a certain kind of warm star."</p>

<p>"That arrangement is just as essential to the existence of my body as my heart, my lungs, and my brain. So to describe myself in a scientific way, I must also describe my surroundings...."</p>

<p>&mdash; Alan Watts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question remains, however, what we mean by being a steward of Earth. Mostly, it means not taking it for granted and including the needs of the natural systems we depend on in our thinking when we design and build our world. For much of our history, our impacts were absorbed by Earth without much fuss, but now we have exceeded the capacity of Earth to clean up our messes for us without consequences.</p>

<p>Therefore:</p>

</div> <!-- discussion -->

<div class="solution">
<p>Respect the natural systems of Earth and take them into consideration when you rethink, design and build our human world. Recognize that our survival is intimately tied to the stability of those systems.</p>
